# Contributing

In case you want to contribute to the GEMS package, please consider that we follow a workflow for the development for which you will find a brief guideline here.
We are excited to see your contibutions to this project!

## Contributing to GEMS
Contributions to this project have to follow the project's open-source license.
The project'S repository can be found here (tbd add link to Github).

To contribute to GEMS, you can choose the options of issues or pull requests.

**Issues**

We use issues to track multiple things at once:

- **Tasks**: Tasks that address future features. We use issues to track implementation/documentation/other tasks necessary and planned to do be done in the current development phase. Every ToDo for the current milestone should be stated as an issue.
- **Bugs**: Bug-reports should also be stated as issues with an explicit description of the problem.

TBD how to open an issues

**Pull requests**

Another way to directly contribute to GEMS is through pull requests.

TBD how to create a pull request


## Style Guides
There is an official style guide for Julia, the [Julia Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/).

This guide was mostly used for the Blue Style. We will follow the [Blue style](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle), but as the Julia Style Guide is a large part of the Blue Style, there wont be many cases, where following the Julia Style Guide would be far off.

Some differences include a 92 character line limit or the snake_case for method names. When in doubt, look at existing code in the project/module/file.

## Change Log / Versions
